## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without external help:

- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What are and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What are and how to implement views in MySQL
- What are and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Tasks

### 0. We are all unique!
**File:** `0-uniq_users.sql`

Create a table `users` with the following attributes:
- `id`: integer, never null, auto increment, primary key
- `email`: string (255 characters), never null, unique
- `name`: string (255 characters)

### 1. In and not out
**File:** `1-country_users.sql`

Create a table `users` with the following attributes:
- `id`: integer, never null, auto increment, primary key
- `email`: string (255 characters), never null, unique
- `name`: string (255 characters)
- `country`: enumeration of countries: US, CO, and TN, never null (default: US)

### 2. Best band ever!
**File:** `2-fans.sql`

Rank country origins of bands by the number of non-unique fans.
- Import table dump: `metal_bands.sql.zip`
- Columns: `origin` and `nb_fans`

### 3. Old school band
**File:** `3-glam_rock.sql`

List all bands with Glam rock as their main style, ranked by their longevity.
- Import table dump: `metal_bands.sql.zip`
- Columns: `band_name` and `lifespan` (in years until 2022)

### 4. Buy buy buy
**File:** `4-store.sql`

Create a trigger to decrease the quantity of an item after adding a new order.
- Context: Updating multiple tables for one action can generate issues; let MySQL handle it.

### 5. Email validation to sent
**File:** `5-valid_email.sql`

Create a trigger to reset the attribute `valid_email` only when the email has been changed.
- Context: Useful for user email validation.

### 6. Add bonus
**File:** `6-bonus.sql`

Create a stored procedure `AddBonus` to add a new correction for a student.
- Procedure `AddBonus` takes 3 inputs: `user_id`, `project_name`, `score`.

### 7. Average score
**File:** `7-average_score.sql`

Create a stored procedure `ComputeAverageScoreForUser` to compute and store the average score for a student.
- Procedure `ComputeAverageScoreForUser` takes 1 input: `user_id`.

### 8. Optimize simple search
**File:** `8-index_my_names.sql`

Create an index `idx_name_first` on the table `names` and the first letter of `name`.
- Context: Indexing can greatly improve performance if used correctly.

## Usage

To execute the scripts, ensure MySQL is running, then use the following command format:

```sh
$ mysql -uroot -p < script_name.sql
```

For example, to execute the `0-uniq_users.sql` script:

```sh
$ mysql -uroot -p < 0-uniq_users.sql
```

Replace `script_name.sql` with the name of the script you wish to execute.
